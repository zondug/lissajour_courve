<img width="688" alt="image" src="https://github.com/zondug/lissajour_curve/assets/13306437/d71abc5e-8f78-4e0d-9c7f-fd9a6193e612">

This program is designed to visualize Lissajous curves using the Godot game engine.

## Features

- Draws Lissajous curves on an 8x8 grid with various frequency combinations.
- Each curve is animated in real-time.
- Allows users to click on a specific curve to print its formula in the console.

## Variables

- `amplitude_x`, `amplitude_y`: Controls the amplitude of the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
- `frequency_x`, `frequency_y`: Controls the angular frequency of the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
- `delta_angle`: Controls the phase difference. (Default value: 90 degrees)
- `speed`: Controls the animation speed.

## Usage

1. Run the program, and Lissajous curves with various frequency combinations will be drawn on an 8x8 grid.
2. Each curve is animated in real-time.
3. Click on a specific curve with the left mouse button to print its formula in the console.

## Lissajous Curves

Lissajous curves are patterns created by combining two harmonic oscillations with different frequencies. This program generates Lissajous curves with various frequency combinations and adds animation effects to visually represent them.

Through this program, users can explore the beautiful patterns of Lissajous curves and gain an understanding of their characteristics by examining the formulas.
